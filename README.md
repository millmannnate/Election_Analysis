## Overview of Election Audit
The original purpose of this project was to create an automated program for reporting election results. The program was then planned to be used in future elections if succesful with the congressional district election. The challenge required county statistics to be added into the results report.

## Election-Audit Summary
This script can be used for other elections with tweaks to the program for specified elections. Voting districts for different levels of election will change, so the county variable could be changed to a different area type. For larger election days, the program could be edited to take in data from a group of elections. The entire election day results could be printed out in a report. Extra statistics could be added into the report as well, such as a breakdown of each region.
